# words-and-definitions-app

This is a user-generated dictionary wherein the user can add words to a list and then add one or more definitions to the words and 
list them out on a page. This app "should" be able to:

* Have the user click on a link that says "add new word" (or something similar).
* Have a page appear that then lists the word.
* Have an opportunity to define the word with up to three definitions, and list them.
* Each added word and definition will take the user to a "success!" page so the user can know that the word/definition was added
successfully. 
* The user can do this as many times as they feel internal joy from doing this.

NOTE** Since I've thought of many ways to completely refactor this (because I did way too many unnecessary steps, specs, and code for this)
it is incomplete. Also it might be not very indicative of how I would do this, as I stopped on Friday at 5pm exactly (left me
with around 3 hours total to do this--this was as far as I got on Friday, but I did carve out some time to draw out what
I really wanted to do with this, but have not had the physical time to implement this , as I will do this weekend.)

Also, thank you all SO MUCH for your patience, your work, and your support. Seriously, this is hard as crap but I am loving
it! In all future code reviews, I will be using an Epicodus computer,so that I can complete the code review without having to 
fight with wifi and spending more time restarting my computer than actual coding.
(and I really dont want to go through all of that nonsense again-my computer is old, and I'm sure with all of the other 
"competing" computers fighting for the same signal my weak hardware most likely is not able to out up a fight like it used to
for wifi "attention".
